thmome
======

thmome wants to be a little calculator for coders.
None of the others does what I want it to do, so I decided to make my own.
And because programming is fun, I want to make a program using GTK, so I can see what that's about.

To learn about thmome's functionality, have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/eBrnd/thmome/wiki)!

thmome is short for [Arithmometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmometer).
